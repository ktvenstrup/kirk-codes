### Intro to Chess Rules and Board

Chess Rules and Board is the official title of the package named kirkspackage. This package is designed to help you learn about chess by exploring pieces, the board, and visualizing movement. It tells the user about the pieces by listing the name, beginning notation, movement, points associated with it (to communicate its value), and the number of that piece on the board. This package also contains a graph of a chess board to show chess board notation and to show how the pieces can move.
