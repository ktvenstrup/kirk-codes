Description: This package is designed to help you learn about chess and to visualize or 
  simulate movements. It tells the user about the pieces, the board, and allows the user to 
  explore different chess movements. For pieces, it lists the name, movement, points 
  associated with it (to communicate its value), and the number of that piece on the board. 
  The package also contains a graph of a chess board to show chess board notation.
